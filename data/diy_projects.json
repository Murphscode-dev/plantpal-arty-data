    "shortDescription": "Create a beautiful, low-maintenance miniature desert landscape for your small succulents.",
    "estimatedTime": "1 - 1.5 hours",
    "difficulty": "Easy to Medium",
    "materials": [
      "Clear glass container (e.g., bowl, vase, jar, or dedicated terrarium)",
      "Assorted small succulents (choose ones with similar light and water needs)",
      "Cactus and succulent potting mix",
      "Small pebbles or gravel (for drainage layer)",
      "Activated charcoal (optional, helps keep soil fresh)",
      "Sphagnum moss (optional, can separate soil from drainage)",
      "Decorative elements (e.g., colored sand, small stones, dried moss, miniature figurines - optional)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Select a clean, clear glass container.",
      "Create a drainage layer: Add a 1-2 inch layer of small pebbles or gravel at the bottom.",
      "Optional: Add a thin layer of activated charcoal over the pebbles.",
      "Optional: Add a thin layer of sphagnum moss to prevent soil from mixing into the drainage layer.",
      "Add a layer of cactus and succulent potting mix, deep enough for your succulents' roots (usually 2-4 inches).",
      "Gently remove your succulents from their nursery pots, carefully loosening any compacted roots.",
      "Arrange the succulents in the terrarium, considering height and spacing. Create small wells for each plant.",
      "Plant the succulents, adding more soil around them to secure them in place. Gently pat the soil down.",
      "Add any decorative elements on top of the soil if desired.",
      "Lightly water the soil around the base of each succulent. Avoid overwatering; succulents prefer drier conditions.",
      "Place the terrarium in a spot that receives bright, indirect sunlight."

    "estimatedTime": "1 - 2 hours (plus drying time)",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "materials": [
      "Plain terracotta pots (various sizes)",
      "Acrylic craft paints (assorted colors)",
      "Paintbrushes (various sizes, including small for details)",
