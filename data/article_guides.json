Different pigments are used to produce color, and minerals such as silica may be used to provide texture. The use of lipstick dates back to early civilizations such as Sumer and the Indus Valley Civilisation, and was popularized in the Western world in the 16th century. Some lipsticks contain traces of toxic materials, such as lead and PFAS, which prompted health concerns and regulation.\n\n### Ideal Light\nN/A\n\n### Watering\nKeep moist between watering.

It is native to South America and its common name comes from its shiny, dark leafstalks that resemble human hair. It typically grows about 17\u201319\u00a0in (43\u201348\u00a0cm) tall and up to 22\u00a0in (56\u00a0cm) wide. In the wild, it is found on forest floors, rock crevices, river banks, coastal cliffs, and basalt banks along trails and streams. The triangular fronds are semi-erect in the beginning then droop gracefully as they age and can be up to 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) long by 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) wide. The genus name Adiantum comes from the Greek word \"adiantos\", meaning \"unwetted\".\n\n### Ideal Light\nN/A\n\n### Watering\nKeep moist between watering.

    "articleContent": "Howea forsteriana, the Kentia palm, thatch palm or palm court palm, is a species of flowering plant in the palm family, Arecaceae, endemic to Lord Howe Island in Australia. It is also widely grown on Norfolk Island. It is a relatively slow-growing palm, eventually growing up to 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) tall by 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) wide. Its fronds can reach 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) long. The palm gets its common name from the capital of Lord Howe Island, Kentia, and the genus name, Howea, from the island itself. The species name \"forsteriana\" is after Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster, father and son, who accompanied Captain Cook as naturalists on his second voyage to the Pacific in 1772\u20131775.\n\n### Ideal Light\nN/A\n\n### Watering\nKeep moist between watering.

As of June\u00a02013, the Plants of the World Online accepted 621 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the family Araceae, after genus Anthurium. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the Greek words philo- 'love, affection' and dendron 'tree'.
