    &quot;question&quot;: &quot;My pet just ate part of a plant, what should I do?&quot;,
    &quot;answer&quot;: &quot;If your pet is showing any symptoms like vomiting, drooling, or lethargy, contact a veterinarian or animal poison control center immediately. Try to identify the plant, as toxicity varies greatly. For many household plants, ingestion may only cause mild oral irritation or stomach upset.&quot;

    &quot;question&quot;: &quot;Why do some plants cause skin irritation or dermatitis?&quot;,
    &quot;answer&quot;: &quot;Many plants have sap or fine hairs containing compounds that can irritate the skin on contact. Plants like Figs (Ficus) or Dumb Canes (Dieffenbachia) contain calcium oxalate crystals that can cause a burning sensation and irritation. Always handle unknown plants with care or use gloves.&quot;
